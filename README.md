# Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms
The following machine learning algorithms were applied to classify the data:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

The KNN algorithm was utilized to classify the data based on the majority vote of its neighbors. The model's performance was evaluated using the ROC curve.

Decision Tree:

Decision trees were used to model the decisions and possible consequences. The ROC curve was also used to evaluate this model's performance.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):

The SVM algorithm was applied to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into classes. The ROC curve was used for performance evaluation.

Ensemble Learning Models:

Boosting: This approach was used to improve the model's accuracy by combining the predictions of multiple weak learners to form a strong learner.
Bagging with SVM: Bagging was combined with SVM to reduce variance and avoid overfitting, providing better stability and accuracy.

Random Forest:

This ensemble learning method was employed to enhance prediction accuracy and control overfitting by averaging the results of various decision trees.

Results:
Among all models, the Bagging with SVM approach yielded the highest accuracy for this dataset, demonstrating superior performance in terms of precision and reliability for breast cancer detectionâ€‹.
